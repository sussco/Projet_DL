# Projet_DL


Implementation of a libraby allowing to create and train classic neural networks and CNN

In /projet_DL/Projet_D/CNN you can find different classes that represent differentent layers of a neural network:
- convLayer: a convolutionnal layer
- Perceptron: one or multiple fully connected layers
- Pool: a Pooling layer
- Relu
- Sigmoid
- Net: the whole network, in which you define the architecture

To train or test a neural network, use mainMnist.py
